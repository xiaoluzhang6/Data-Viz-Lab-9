The orginal dashboard had several problems; first, aside from the ranking chart, the second and third sets tables are just presenting raw data in its raw form. A recruiter would not be able to understand quickly the claims the presenter is trying to make, and spend extra time understanding the information on the table. Also, there was no combining of information for the data; each table presents a very independent set of data. Finally, the capstone project information might not be relevant information here; the recruiter needs to first understand what the program is for each school, and than interpret the implications of the data. The improved version is below:<br><br>

In the improved version, I improved the presentation of the data on the tables by combining average admission GPA and the skill coverage of courses; in both case, the recruiter will get the idea that students at SCU are harder working (higher average GPA) and will be equipped with the most desired work skills on the current market (Linkedin Skills). If the recruiter is interested in the details of specific skills ranking, they will only need to go to the link in the source list. By combining these two metrics into the same graph, the audience will be able to quickly understand the information presented on the dashboard without much background info. The use of quadrant chart also acts as guidance for the viewer; it is clear that point in the top right quadrant is the highest rated school and those on the left/bottom left is less superior.<br>
